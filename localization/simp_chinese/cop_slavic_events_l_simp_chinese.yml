On Maslenitsa, Perun and Mokosh are celebrating their wedding in the heavens, and we need to do our part to bring fertility back to earth.\n\n#EMP A girl went bathing and saw a mouse in the bath.\nThat wasn't a mouse, that was a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.BishopMale]'s cock!#!\n\nThe song is over and all eyes turn to a naked skomorokh. He's holding a bunch of green birch twigs, claiming that he is Mokosh bathing in a banya, cursing like crazy and playing a hilarious pantomime.\n\nAfter he is done, the dancing starts. All around, skirts are flapping, skomorokhs are happily singing about male and female private parts, and dancers are getting closer and closer."
