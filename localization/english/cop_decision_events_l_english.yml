 cop_slavic_decision_event.0010.desc:0 "With Morana banished, Dazhbog the Sun god is flooding the fields with light and warmth. But  without rain the heat will scorch the earth, and the crops will wither without growing. That is why the villagers in [capital_county.GetNameNoTier] are holding a rite to summon Dodola, the goddess of rain.\n\nThe preparations are well under way, led by [realm_priest.GetCouncilTitleFirstName]. There is much to do: choose the girl who will represent Dodola, bring oak leaves for her garment and enough water to spray on the dancers, cook the food for the feast afterwards and so much more.\n\nThe more lavish the ritual is, the more likely Dodola is to grace us with her presence. How much am I willing to spend?"

 cop_slavic_decision_event.0020.desc:0 "Several young women from the village are chosen to be Dodole, dressed in simple clothing and covered in oak branches and leaves. They will dance and sing in effort to summon Dodola, goddess of rain, to shower on this thirsty land.\n\nHowever, local drought made oak leaves scarce, with only a single small tree still bearing leaves in the entire village.\n\nWe can proceed with what we have, or send someone to a nearby forest for more fresh leaves."
 cop_slavic_decision_event.0020.a:0 "I'll send some of my people for the leaves."
 cop_slavic_decision_event.0020.a.tt:0 "You are likely to #P succeed#!, but there can also be unexpected results, both #P positive#! and #N negative #!"
