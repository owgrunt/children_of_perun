That is why the villagers in [capital_county.GetNameNoTier] are holding a rite to summon Dodola, Perun's companion, the summoner of rain.\n\nThe preparations are well under way, led by [realm_priest.GetCouncilTitleFirstName]. There is much to do: choose the girl who will represent Dodola, bring oak leaves for her garment and enough water to spray on the dancers, cook the food for the feast afterwards and so much more.\n\nThe more lavish the ritual is, the more likely Dodola is to grace us with her presence.
